### 2025-01-16: Fixed Training Questions Limitation - Now Shows All Questions
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Training system was only showing 5 questions instead of all questions from JSON files
**Root Cause**: Backend API endpoint defaulted to `all_questions=False`, returning only 5 predefined questions

**Root Cause**: Frontend code was expecting `name` and `question_count` fields, but backend API returns `category` and `total_questions`

**Files Modified**:
- `Model_Myself/src/App.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Fixed loadTrainingCategories function**:
   - Changed `category.name` to `category.category`
   - Changed `category.question_count` to `category.total_questions`

2. **Fixed TrainingCard trainingOptions mapping**:
   - Updated to use `cat.category` and `cat.total_questions`

3. **Verified category parsing**:
   - Confirmed `.split(' (')[0]` correctly extracts category name for TrainingPopup

**Result**: ✅ Training dropdown now shows correct categories with question counts:
- "Questions about my knowledge (360 questions)"
- "Questions about my feelings and 5 personalities (409 questions)"
