# Running Log & System Change History

## [Date: 2024-06-09]

### Added: Knowledge Graph Scripts
- **graph.py**: Implements a knowledge graph for personality mapping. Supports:
  - Initial categories: Knowledge, Feelings, Personalities, ImportanceOfPeople, Preferences, Morals, AutomaticQuestions
  - Adding Q&A nodes under categories
  - Adding relationships between nodes
  - Saving/loading the graph as a pickle file
  - Example insertions for each category
- **visualize_graph.py**: Visualizes the knowledge graph using NetworkX and matplotlib.
  - Loads the graph from file
  - Colors nodes by category
  - Labels nodes with questions or category names

**Usage:**
- Run `graph.py` to create and save the initial graph: `python graph.py`
- Run `visualize_graph.py` to visualize the graph: `python visualize_graph.py`

### Added: /knowledge-graph API Endpoint
- **main.py**: New endpoint `/knowledge-graph` returns the knowledge graph as JSON (nodes and links) for D3.js visualization in the frontend. Loads the graph from `analysis/graph.py` and serializes it for network visualization.
- **Fixed import issues**: Updated import path to use relative imports for the graph module
- **Enhanced endpoint**: Added proper error handling, logging, and automatic creation of example data if no graph exists
- **Dependencies**: Installed networkx and matplotlib for graph functionality
- **Frontend integration**: Updated KnowledgeGraphD3.tsx to use the API utility function from utils/api.tsx

**Backend Route Status**: âœ… Working - `/knowledge-graph` endpoint properly fetches and returns graph data
