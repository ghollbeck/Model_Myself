### Training Data Structure
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "knowledge_001",
      "question": "What is your favorite subject?",
      "type": "text",
      "placeholder": "Enter your answer...",
      "category": "knowledge",
      "metadata": {
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "subcategory": "interests"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Knowledge Graph Integration
- NetworkX for graph data structure
- D3.js for interactive visualization
- Automatic node creation from training data
- Hierarchical relationship mapping
- Real-time updates and refresh

### Training System Flow
1. User selects training category
2. Frontend fetches questions from JSON files
3. User answers questions in popup interface
4. Answers saved to backend with timestamps
5. Knowledge graph automatically updated
6. Training progress tracked and displayed

### API Layer Architecture
- Centralized API functions in `utils/api.tsx`
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Automatic logging of all API interactions

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Full training system with 2,034 questions
- ‚úÖ JSON-based question management
- ‚úÖ Dynamic frontend integration
- ‚úÖ Knowledge graph visualization
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ MongoDB document storage
- ‚úÖ Real-time training progress tracking
